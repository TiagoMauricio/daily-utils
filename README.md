# Day to day utils

File Directory with custom scripts and utilities to improve productivity and work life quality. These scripts are mostly very basic and I hope to have most of them work out of the box, and if not, they shall have instructions on how to inside.

### Who is this for?
People that work in tech, that need/want to use a terminal during their daily lives and want to improve their experience a tiny bit.

### How to use?
However you may feel like. Suggestion is to use alias or just add the directory to your path, by adding to the end of your .bashrc (or .zshrc or others):
```
export PATH="<FULL_PATH>/daily-utils:$PATH"
```

### What can I do with it?
Everything. Free unlicensed software.

### Why was this created?
Realised that I was doing this everytime I had to configure a new terminal. Thought it was a fun simple project to have public and might help others. Also a good place to point when someone asks about my configs.

### Contribute

If you have any daily utils of your own and you want to share, please make a pr to this repo.
